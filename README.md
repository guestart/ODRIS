# Welcome to use odris

## 1. Whait is odris ?
odris is the first letter abbreviation of `O`racle `D`atabase `R`outine `I`nspection `S`hell and SQL Script.
Before you use this source code of my Shell and SQL script files you first read this license file seriously (https://github.com/guestart/odris/blob/master/LICENSE).
As you can see odris has included two section "odris_aix" and "odris_linux".
