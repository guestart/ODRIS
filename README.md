# Welcome to use ODRIS

### What is ODRIS ?

**ODRIS** is the first letter abbreviation of **O**racle **D**atabase **R**outine **I**nspection **S**cript (including `Oracle SQL` and `Unix Ksh/Linux Bash`), which can be easily deployed to customer/client's Oracle Database Server (<font color=red>Attention</font>: It'll not change/modify their oracle environment just only check oracle dynamic performance view by several SQL select statement), then run it to generate specific report with TXT format quickly.
Before you use this source code of my Shell and SQL script files you first read this license file seriously (https://github.com/guestart/odris/blob/master/LICENSE).
As you can see odris has included two section "odris_aix" and "odris_linux".
